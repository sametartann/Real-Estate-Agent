# **Real-Estate Agent Project (September 16, 2022)**
Java Data Structures and Algorithms Project

## Information

In this project, designed and implemented a Java program for a real-estate agent to keep all house adverts in a list and use them when needed.

A real-estate agent can use that list with the given functionalities below.

- House adverts are sorted by price. (sortByPrice)
- House adverts are sorted by state. (sortByState)
- Every 10th advert is displayed in red on the console. (findMultiplesOfTen)
- Average prices for rental houses are displayed on the console. (calculateAverageForRental)
- The same advert should not be added to the list.

ArrayList data structure is used for this program. For the sortByPrice method, selection sort is used. For the sortByState method, bubble sort is used.

## How To Run

To run this program perfectly, please follow the descriptions.

- First, you need to run the Main.java and write 'y' to add a house or 'n' to not add a house anymore.
- If you wrote 'y', then you should enter the information of state (String), price (double), and type (String). For the state field, you may consider “rental” or “sale” kinds of states. The prices of the houses are considered with only 2 digits after the comma.

**Regards!**
